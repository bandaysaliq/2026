Build a minimal, ultra-clean live wallpaper webpage for a laptop.
The wallpaper must show 2026 year progress in three forms:

Percentage of 2026 completed (auto-updating in real time)

Exact number of days left in 2026

A dot-matrix grid where dots fill progressively based on the percentage passed (dark background, white dots, modern aesthetic like a futuristic time-tracker).

Design requirements:

Black / very dark background

Minimal, Apple-level UI

Dot grid centered on screen

Large percentage text below grid

Days-left text below percentage

Responsive for laptop screens

No external libraries

Pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript in a single index.html file

Logic requirements:

Start date: January 1, 2026 00:00

End date: January 1, 2027 00:00

Automatically calculates progress and days remaining

Fills dot grid proportionally

Updates on page refresh (or optionally every minute)

Output requirements:

Provide complete, ready-to-host index.html code

Clean, readable, commented code

Optimized to be used as a live wallpaper via a website URL (GitHub Pages / Lively Wallpaper compatible)
